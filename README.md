## Drone-GroundStation-Application
We developed a ground station software for a drone capable of operating both as an aerial and ground vehicle to participate in TEKNOFEST. This software meets all operational requirements of the drone, providing efficient control and data tracking.

This project involves the development of a custom ground station for a drone capable of operating both as an aerial and ground vehicle. The entire design of the ground station was created using Canva, ensuring a unique and user-friendly interface.

## Features

### 1. **Custom Design**
The ground station interface was designed from scratch using Canva, offering a distinctive and intuitive user experience.

### 2. **Map Integration**
We integrated OpenStreetMap into the interface, allowing real-time tracking of the droneâ€™s location. The map data is fetched and displayed via an embedded HTML solution, ensuring seamless updates during flight operations.

### 3. **Weather Information**
We utilized the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve real-time weather data, including wind speed and temperature, to enhance flight safety and decision-making during operations.

### 4. **Mathematical Functions and Coordination**
By collaborating with my teammate, we developed mathematical functions and connection protocols to ensure accurate data transmission and real-time updates between the drone and the ground station.

### 5. **Data Verification**
All retrieved and processed data were tested for accuracy using Mission Planner, ensuring that the drone's flight information and weather conditions were reliable and precise.
